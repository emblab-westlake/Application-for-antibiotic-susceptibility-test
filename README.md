# Bioimage
This application can be used for antibiotic-susceptibility test.
Bioimage is specifically developed for recording the hue value. The hue value can be obtained using the insert algorithm based on the Hue-Saturation-Lightness (HSL) color space which was converted from the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) after selecting the target area in the image.
Free for non-commercial use.
